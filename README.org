#+TITLE: Homebrew Tap for the Marmaduke Chromium builds

If you're looking for a macOS build of the latest stable Chromium
which includes modern video codecs such as H.264, then the marmaduke
builds as advertised on [[https://chromium.woolyss.com/#mac][Woolyss]] are your best bet.

This homebrew tap was created for the easy installation of
above-mentioned builds.

To install do:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
brew tap cpbotha/marmaduke-chromium
brew cask install marmaduke-chromium
#+END_SRC

If you prefer the build without google sync and widevine (which you do
need to play for example Netflix), then rather install:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
brew cask install marmaduke-chromium-nosync
#+END_SRC

From here on, =brew update && brew cask outdated= will also tell you
when your chromium needs updating, in which case a simple =brew
upgrade marmaduke-chromium= will do the trick.

My RSS reader keeps on eye on the [[https://github.com/macchrome/macstable/releases][marmaduke releases]], but please [[https://github.com/cpbotha/homebrew-marmaduke-chromium/issues][file
an issue]] here if you notice that we're out of date!
